## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, saturated blue (#3B82F6) to establish a trustworthy and professional atmosphere, but a shade distinct from the user's specification to avoid cliche.
- Secondary color: Financial green (#008000) to symbolize growth and financial prosperity.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F9FF), near white, to maintain a clean and uncluttered layout. Derived from the hue of the primary color.
- Accent color: A strong yellow (#EAB308) for highlighting key interactive elements, derived from the blue but shifted to an analogous position on the color wheel to add visual interest and direct user attention.
- Dark theme: Black (#000000) used for the dark theme to maintain a professional and sophisticated feel.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to convey a precise and contemporary feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a modern look.
- Employ a set of minimalistic icons in a thin line style, using the primary blue, financial green, and yellow colors to represent different markets, tools, and platform features.
- Use a grid-based layout to ensure responsiveness and consistency across all devices. Incorporate sufficient white space to improve readability and create a modern, clean aesthetic.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for UI elements, such as button hover effects and loading spinners, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
